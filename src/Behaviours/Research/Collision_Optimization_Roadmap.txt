Below is the same roadmap you’ve been using, now expanded with the additional techniques, memory optimizations, and GPU/parallelization strategies we discovered in deeper research. By layering them in incremental steps, you can address performance bottlenecks one at a time without overcomplicating your code prematurely.

1. Baseline: Naïve Bullet–Enemy Collision
Spawn Projectiles & Store Them

In gameState.projectiles (or a dedicated manager).
Each projectile has (x, y, width, height) in the same coordinate space as enemies.
Naïve Double Loop

js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < projectiles.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < enemies.length; j++) {
    if (isCollidingAABB(projectiles[i], enemies[j])) {
      // Handle collision (damage enemy, remove projectile, etc.)
    }
  }
}
This is O(B × E) and will become expensive for large bullet or enemy counts.
Wall Collisions (Tile-Based)

js
Copy
Edit
function isCollisionWithWall(px, py) {
  const tileX = Math.floor(px / TILE_SIZE);
  const tileY = Math.floor(py / TILE_SIZE);
  const tile = map.getTile(tileX, tileY);
  return !tile || tile.type === TILE_IDS.WALL || tile.type === TILE_IDS.MOUNTAIN;
}
Already efficient, O(1) per check, because walls are static in your tile map.
Result
Everything works but may slow down drastically with many bullets and enemies.
2. Basic Optimizations
2.1 Collision Layers / Masks
Assign each projectile/enemy a collision mask or category. For instance:
Player bullets: Collide with enemies and walls, ignore other bullets.
Enemy bullets: Collide with the player, ignore other enemies/bullets.
Immediate Gain: If bullet–bullet collisions are not needed, you skip them entirely.
2.2 Precompute AABB Edges
Before your collision loop, do:
js
Copy
Edit
entity.xmin = entity.x;
entity.xmax = entity.x + entity.width;
entity.ymin = entity.y;
entity.ymax = entity.y + entity.height;
Then your collision check is a short 4-comparison formula:
js
Copy
Edit
function isCollidingAABB(a, b) {
  return !(
    a.xmax <= b.xmin || a.xmin >= b.xmax ||
    a.ymax <= b.ymin || a.ymin >= b.ymax
  );
}
Reduces arithmetic overhead per check.
Result
Fewer property lookups and wasted checks, but still O(n²) if bullet or enemy counts grow large.
3. Broad-Phase to Reduce Pairs
3.1 Uniform Grid (Spatial Hashing)
Divide the world into cells, e.g. 64×64.
For each bullet/enemy, compute which cell(s) they occupy and store them there:
js
Copy
Edit
const cellX = Math.floor(obj.x / CELL_SIZE);
const cellY = Math.floor(obj.y / CELL_SIZE);
grid[cellX][cellY].push(obj);
Collision: Only check bullets vs. enemies in the same or neighboring cells.
Pros:

Straightforward, works well if the world is not extremely sparse or if your objects are roughly uniformly distributed.
3.2 Sweep-and-Prune (Sort-and-Sweep)
Sort objects by xmin.
Sweep along the x-axis, quickly skipping pairs that don’t overlap in x.
If they overlap in x, check y overlap or do a short AABB check.
Pros:

Very efficient if objects move gradually (you can incrementally update the sorted lists).
Commonly used in 2D/3D physics engines (e.g., Box2D, Bullet) as a broad-phase.
Either broad-phase method drastically reduces pair checks from O(n²) to near O(n + m) in typical distributions.

4. SoA (Structure of Arrays) for Narrow-Phase
Even after a broad-phase, you might have many collisions in dense areas. SoA speeds up the per-check overhead:

Collect Overlap Candidates from your broad-phase. Suppose you have k bullets and m enemies in the same cell.
Store bounding boxes in typed arrays:
js
Copy
Edit
const bulletXmin = new Float32Array(k);
const bulletXmax = new Float32Array(k);
const bulletYmin = new Float32Array(k);
const bulletYmax = new Float32Array(k);
// similarly for enemies
Loop over these arrays in a tight loop, avoiding object property lookups:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
    if (!(bulletXmax[i] <= enemyXmin[j] || /* etc */)) {
      // collision
    }
  }
}
Why SoA? Minimizes cache misses and is more SIMD-friendly than storing all data as { xMin, xMax, yMin, ... } objects.
5. WASM + SIMD for the Hot Path
Write a Function in C/C++/Rust:
c
Copy
Edit
void checkCollisionsSoA(
    float* bulletXmin, float* bulletXmax, float* bulletYmin, float* bulletYmax, int bulletCount,
    float* enemyXmin,  float* enemyXmax, float* enemyYmin, float* enemyYmax, int enemyCount,
    unsigned char* collisionFlags
) {
  // Possibly use SIMD intrinsics or let compiler auto-vectorize
}
Compile to WebAssembly with SIMD (-msimd128).
In JS, pass pointers (offsets in linear memory) for the typed arrays to that function.
Read back which bullet–enemy pairs overlapped and apply damage or remove bullets as needed.
Result:

Narrow-phase collision checks are accelerated by vector instructions at near-native speed.
Handles thousands of collisions each frame smoothly.
6. Continue Using Tile Lookups for Walls
Tile-based walls remain extremely efficient (O(1) checks) because they are stationary.
Bullets simply do:
js
Copy
Edit
if (isCollisionWithWall(newBulletX, newBulletY)) {
  // remove bullet or handle bounce
}
No need to insert walls in your dynamic broad-phase. They are effectively in their own static grid (the tile map).
7. Optional Advanced Steps
7.1 Multi-Threading with Web Workers
Offload collision detection (broad-phase + narrow-phase) to a Worker.
Main thread handles rendering and input; the Worker returns collision results in a shared buffer (using SharedArrayBuffer).
Benefits: True parallelism on multi-core CPUs. Great if bullet counts are extremely high.
7.2 Continuous Collision (Line/Ray Tests)
If bullets move so fast they might skip over small objects or walls in one frame, do a ray or segment intersection check from oldPos → newPos.
Still feed them into the broad-phase (so you only do segment checks against local objects).
7.3 GPU Collision (WebGPU Compute)
For extreme bullet counts (tens of thousands), you can run broad-phase and even narrow-phase on the GPU using compute shaders.
Challenges:
Managing data transfer overhead and pipeline synchronization.
WebGPU is still new, so not all browsers support it widely.
Potential massive parallel speedup if your game can handle 1-frame or partial-frame delays in collision data.
8. Extended Techniques from Deep Research
Here are additional optimizations you can weave into the roadmap if your scale grows:

Memory Pooling & Chunking

Pre-allocate bullet objects to avoid constant GC overhead.
Recycle them by marking them inactive when they die, reusing the same memory for new bullets.
Hybrid / Hierarchical Grids

If object distribution is extremely uneven, subdivide large cells into smaller sub-grids in dense areas.
Similar to quadtrees but simpler to maintain if you prefer grid logic.
AoSoA Layout

Instead of pure SoA, use Array of Structures of Arrays in blocks matching your SIMD width (e.g., 4 objects per block).
Improves cache usage while still being vector-friendly.
Temporal Coherence

Reuse last frame’s broad-phase data (e.g., sorted lists or cell assignments), only update objects that moved.
Reduces overhead when object movement is small relative to cell size.
Parallelizing the Broad-Phase

If you have multiple CPU cores, let each worker handle a subset of the grid (or subdivide the domain).
Merge candidate pairs in the end.
GPU + CPU Hybrid

GPU can handle a massive broad-phase pass (hashing or BVH), CPU does final narrow-phase or game logic.
Minimizes data transfer if you carefully pipeline the work.
Collision Rule Tweaks

Further reduce checks by disabling collisions among certain groups of objects (e.g., same-faction units).
Dynamically toggle collision for objects that don’t need it currently (like sleeping enemies or off-screen bullets).
9. Final Overview
Current Setup

Tile-based wall collisions (already O(1) per check).
Possibly naive O(n²) bullet–enemy checks.
Step-by-Step Path

Collision Layers & Precompute Edges.
Broad-Phase (Grid or Sweep-and-Prune) to cull non-overlapping objects quickly.
Convert final collision loops to SoA to reduce overhead.
Move SoA collision code to WASM + SIMD for maximum speed.
(Optional) Multi-threading or GPU if you still need performance beyond the above steps.
Beyond That

Memory pooling, temporal coherence, hierarchical grids, or AoSoA if bullet counts skyrocket further.
Or push collisions to WebGPU or multi-threaded WASM for maximum parallelism.
This expanded roadmap ensures you address the most impactful optimizations first (like broad-phase, SoA, SIMD) and only add more advanced or specialized techniques (hierarchical grids, GPU compute) if your game demands it. Meanwhile, your tile-based wall collisions remain trivially fast, so you never waste time updating stationary geometry. By iterating step by step, you’ll keep your code maintainable while scaling to handle a true bullet-hell scenario if needed.
