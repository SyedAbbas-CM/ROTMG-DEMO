Below is an all-in-one roadmap that layers each major collision optimization onto your existing codebase. This includes the straightforward tile-based wall collisions, the more challenging bullet–enemy collisions, and paths to advanced techniques like SoA, WASM SIMD, and even GPU for truly large-scale performance.

1. Baseline: Naïve Bullet–Enemy Collision
Spawn Projectiles and Store Them

In gameState.projectiles (or a dedicated manager).
Each projectile has (x, y) coordinates (preferably in the same coordinate space as enemies).
Naïve Double Loop

In your update() function or a dedicated updateProjectiles() step:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < projectiles.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < enemies.length; j++) {
    if (isCollidingAABB(projectiles[i], enemies[j])) {
      // Handle collision (damage enemy, remove projectile, etc.)
    }
  }
}
This is O(B × E), quickly becoming slow if you have hundreds or thousands of projectiles and enemies.
Wall Collisions: Already Tile-Based

You already do a tile lookup for character movement. For projectiles, you can do the same:
js
Copy
Edit
function isCollisionWithWall(px, py) {
  const tileX = Math.floor(px / TILE_SIZE);
  const tileY = Math.floor(py / TILE_SIZE);
  const tile = map.getTile(tileX, tileY);
  return !tile || tile.type === TILE_IDS.WALL || tile.type === TILE_IDS.MOUNTAIN;
}
This is extremely efficient (O(1) lookups) for stationary geometry. Good job on that part.
Result

You have a working system but might be slow if you have many bullets and enemies.
2. Basic Optimizations
2.1 Collision Layers / Masks
Assign each object a collision mask or category.
Projectiles (player bullets) collide only with enemies (and walls).
Enemy bullets might collide only with the player, not each other.
This immediately reduces your pair checks if, for example, bullet–bullet collisions don’t matter.
2.2 Precompute AABB Edges
Each update() for bullets/enemies:
js
Copy
Edit
entity.xmin = entity.x;
entity.xmax = entity.x + entity.width;
entity.ymin = entity.y;
entity.ymax = entity.y + entity.height;
Then your collision check is a quick 4-comparison logic:
js
Copy
Edit
function isCollidingAABB(a, b) {
  return !(a.xmax <= b.xmin || a.xmin >= b.xmax ||
           a.ymax <= b.ymin || a.ymin >= b.ymax);
}
Result

Fewer comparisons and property lookups per check.
Still O(n²) in the worst case, but each check is cheaper.
3. Broad-Phase to Reduce Pairs
After you have even a moderate number of bullets (100s) and enemies (10s or 100s), the naive O(n²) approach may be too slow.

3.1 Uniform Grid
Create a Grid: For example, 64×64 or 128×128 cells spanning your world.
Each Frame, clear it and assign objects (bullets, enemies) to their cell(s).
js
Copy
Edit
const cellX = Math.floor(obj.x / CELL_SIZE);
const cellY = Math.floor(obj.y / CELL_SIZE);
grid[cellX][cellY].push(obj);
Collision:
Only check bullets vs. enemies in the same cell (and neighboring cells if needed).
This drastically reduces pair checks if your world or distribution of objects is large.
Pros

Very easy to implement in 2D, especially if you’re already dealing with tiles.
Typically enough for bullet-hell style games like RotMG.
3.2 Sweep-and-Prune (Alternatively)
Sort bullets by their xmin. Sort enemies by their xmin.
Sweep across the x-axis to skip non-overlapping bounding intervals.
If objects overlap in x, do the y-overlap check, etc.
Because bullets/enemies only move small amounts each frame, you can do incremental updates to keep the list mostly sorted each frame.
Pros

Great if your objects spread out or move smoothly.
Sometimes simpler than a grid if your map is more linear or you prefer 1D sorting.
Either method drastically cuts down on pair checks from O(n²) to near O(n + m) in the best case.

4. SoA (Structure of Arrays) for Narrow-Phase
Even after a broad-phase, you might still have many collisions to check every frame (for instance, if 100 bullets are in the same cell as 50 enemies).

Collect Overlap Candidates:
The broad-phase will yield pairs or smaller subsets of bullets/enemies that might collide.
Store Their BBoxes in typed arrays:
js
Copy
Edit
const bulletXmin = new Float32Array(bulletCount);
const bulletXmax = new Float32Array(bulletCount);
const bulletYmin = new Float32Array(bulletCount);
const bulletYmax = new Float32Array(bulletCount);
// similarly for enemies
Loop Over These Arrays for final collision checks:
js
Copy
Edit
for (let i = 0; i < bulletCount; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < enemyCount; j++) {
    if (!( bulletXmax[i] <= enemyXmin[j] || bulletXmin[i] >= enemyXmax[j] ||
           bulletYmax[i] <= enemyYmin[j] || bulletYmin[i] >= enemyYmax[j] )) {
      // collision
    }
  }
}
Why SoA?

Minimizes pointer-chasing and property lookups.
Better CPU cache performance.
Paves the way to SIMD acceleration.
5. WASM + SIMD for the Hot Path
Write a CollisionsSoA Function in C/C++/Rust:
c
Copy
Edit
// pseudo-C code
void checkCollisionsSoA(
    float* bulletXmin, float* bulletXmax, float* bulletYmin, float* bulletYmax, int bulletCount,
    float* enemyXmin,  float* enemyXmax,  float* enemyYmin,  float* enemyYmax,  int enemyCount,
    unsigned char* collisionFlags // or some result array
) {
  // possibly use SSE/AVX intrinsics or let compiler auto-vectorize
}
Compile to WASM with SIMD support (e.g. Emscripten -msimd128).
In JS, pass typed array memory offsets to the WASM function.
Read Back a collisions array or bitmask indicating which bullet–enemy pairs collided.
Apply your game logic (damage, bullet removal, etc.) in JS or also do that in WASM.
Result

The final narrow-phase is processed at near-native speed in parallel instructions.
This can handle thousands of collisions per frame without stalling.
6. Continue Using Tile Lookups for Walls
Throughout all these steps, walls remain cheap to check because they’re stored in a tile map. A bullet just does:

js
Copy
Edit
if (isCollisionWithWall(newBulletX, newBulletY)) {
  // remove bullet, or bounce, etc.
}
No need to update a broad-phase data structure for static walls.

7. Optional Advanced Steps
7.1 Multi-Threading with Web Workers
If collisions become a bottleneck, offload the entire collision pipeline (broad-phase + narrow-phase) to a Worker.
The main thread handles rendering while the Worker returns collision results each frame.
7.2 Continuous Collision for Fast Bullets
If bullets move so fast they skip past tiles or enemies in one frame, do a ray or line-segment intersection approach.
Use the broad-phase to find potential collisions along the bullet’s trajectory.
7.3 GPU Collision (WebGPU)
For extremely large object counts (tens of thousands of bullets), you might do broad-phase + narrow-phase on the GPU with compute shaders.
WebGPU is the modern standard for compute in browsers, but it’s still not as widely supported as WebGL. This is an advanced path.
Final Overview
Current State:
Tile-based wall collisions (good).
Potentially naive O(n²) bullet–enemy checks.
Step 1: Add collision layers, precompute bounding box edges.
Step 2: Implement broad-phase (grid or sweep-and-prune) to skip checking bullets & enemies that are far apart.
Step 3: Convert your final collision loops to SoA to reduce overhead.
Step 4: For big bullet-hell scenarios, move the SoA code into WASM + SIMD for maximum speed.
Step 5 (Optional): Multi-thread (Web Workers) or GPU-based collisions if you still need more performance.
This roadmap ensures you incrementally add only as much complexity as you need, while keeping your tile-based walls cheaply handled by the existing lookup logic.
