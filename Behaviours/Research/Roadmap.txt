Step 1: Establish a Baseline for All Systems
Enemy Behaviors:
Implement a simple finite state machine (FSM) or behavior tree for NPCs.
Ensure basic actions like patrolling, detecting the player, and shooting are in place.
Bullet System:
Create a basic bullet manager that spawns projectiles when an enemy “fires.”
Store bullets as objects in a global array.
Update positions and lifetimes with a naïve update loop.
Collision Detection:
Use a simple double-loop to check for bullet–enemy collisions (AABB tests).
Handle tile-based wall collisions with fast tile lookups.
Outcome:
All three systems are functional and interdependent, even though they’re unoptimized.

Step 2: Build a Data-Oriented Foundation (SoA/ECS) Across Systems
Unified Data Storage:
Convert enemy, bullet, and collision-relevant data into contiguous, typed arrays (SoA).
For enemies: arrays for positions, velocities, AI state, etc.
For bullets: arrays for position (x, y, z), velocity, lifetime, and behavior parameters.
Adopt ECS Concepts:
Group common functionality (movement, shooting, collision) into systems that operate on these arrays.
Outcome:
Improved cache locality and reduced per-object allocation overhead, setting the stage for unified updates.

Step 3: Implement a Unified Batched Update Loop & Memory Pooling
Single Update Loop:
Create one main loop that:
Updates enemy AI (movement, decision making, shooting triggers).
Processes bullet updates (position, lifetime, behavior) in a batched manner.
Performs collision detection between bullets and enemies.
Efficient Removal:
Use swap-and-pop techniques for bullets (and enemies, if needed) to maintain dense arrays.
Implement object pooling to recycle bullet and enemy “slots.”
Outcome:
Lower function call overhead and continuous, dense data arrays across enemy and bullet systems.

Step 4: Integrate Spatial Partitioning for Collision Efficiency
Broad-Phase Collision:
Divide the game world into cells (uniform grid, quadtree, or BVH).
Assign both bullets and enemies to spatial cells based on their positions.
Limit collision checks to objects in the same or neighboring cells.
Tile-Based Wall Checks:
Continue using fast tile lookups for stationary geometry (walls, mountains).
Outcome:
Significantly reduced pair checks (from O(n²) to near linear complexity in typical cases).

Step 5: Enhance Enemy AI with Time-Slicing, LOD, & Event-Driven Updates
Time-Slicing & LOD:
Update enemies on a round-robin or distance-based schedule (near-player vs. offscreen).
Apply “lite” AI for off-screen or distant NPCs to save CPU cycles.
Event-Driven Behavior:
Implement an event bus so enemies trigger shooting or state changes only when necessary (e.g., when a player enters range).
Outcome:
Enemy behavior remains responsive where it matters while drastically reducing unnecessary CPU work.

Step 6: Optimize the Bullet System for Rendering and Behavior
Batched Bullet Updates:
Update all bullet positions, velocities, and lifetimes in a tight, vectorized loop over SoA arrays.
Rendering Optimization:
Use instanced rendering (e.g., THREE.InstancedMesh) or custom buffer geometries/point sprites to draw thousands of bullets with a single (or few) draw calls.
Data-Driven Behaviors:
Store individual bullet parameters (angular velocity, acceleration, spawn delays) in extra arrays.
Update bullet behaviors uniformly within the batched loop.
Outcome:
Efficient processing and rendering of high bullet counts without per-object overhead.

Step 7: Accelerate Critical Paths with Parallelization (WASM + SIMD & Web Workers)
Offload Heavy Computation:
Identify hot loops (e.g., collision checks, enemy update logic, bullet update loops).
Write these routines in C/C++/Rust and compile to WebAssembly with SIMD support.
Multi-Threading:
Use Web Workers with SharedArrayBuffers to distribute:
Bullet and enemy update tasks.
Broad-phase collision computations.
Implement double-buffering of AI state to prevent race conditions.
Outcome:
Near-native performance on computationally heavy tasks, leveraging multiple CPU cores and SIMD for vectorized operations.

Step 8: Integrate Hierarchical AI & Decision Caching
Hierarchical Grouping:
Organize enemies into squads with a commander system that makes high-level decisions (including when to shoot).
Let individual enemies follow squad commands, reducing redundant decision-making.
Caching & Priority Scheduling:
Cache decisions using dirty flags and cooldowns.
Employ strict priority scheduling: critical actions (like shooting) are always processed, while lower-priority updates are throttled.
Outcome:
Coordinated, scalable enemy behaviors that are responsive and efficient even under heavy load.

Step 9: Final Integration, Profiling, and Dynamic Tuning
System Integration:
Combine the enemy AI, bullet management, and collision detection systems into a single, unified update and render loop.
Profiling & Balancing:
Use tools (Chrome DevTools, memory profilers) to monitor CPU cycles and memory usage.
Fine-tune update frequencies, grid cell sizes, and worker/SIMD batch sizes based on live performance data.
Adaptive Tuning:
Implement runtime adjustments (adaptive ticks, dynamic LOD) to maintain a smooth frame rate under varying loads.
Outcome:
A robust, cohesive system where enemy behaviors, bullet updates, and collision detection all run in concert at peak efficiency.

Step 10: Iterate and Expand with Advanced Add-Ons
Advanced GPU Techniques:
Consider GPU-driven collision detection or pathfinding via WebGPU compute shaders if further parallelism is needed.
AI Streaming & Off-Screen Optimization:
Fully “stream” off-screen enemies (remove from main ECS) and reinitialize them only when relevant.
Machine Learning:
Explore ML-based models for approximate off-screen battle resolutions.
Ongoing Refinement:
Continuously profile, stress-test, and adjust system parameters to adapt to new gameplay scenarios or increasing entity counts.
Outcome:
An ultra-optimized, scalable framework that seamlessly integrates enemy AI, bullet management, and collision detection while maximizing CPU and memory efficiency.
